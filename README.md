 ## Current IT SETUP
### The system is currently installed on premises.

## Proposed Deployment Architecture in cloud
 An application that is ready for the cloud will almost always have its deployment architecture 
impacted by the services offered by the cloud vendor.The choice of cloud services becomes extremely crucial for 
an application that must operate under strict compliance and data residency requirements.

## Cloud Storage  vs ON-Premises Storage
##  On Premise Advantages
### Total Cost of Ownership — An on-premise solution may have a lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) than a cloud system since you only need to pay for your user licenses once.
###           Total command - You own all of your data, hardware, and software platforms. You make the configuration, updates, and system modifications.
###           Uptime - With on-premise solutions, you may access your software without depending on the internet or other external variables.
## Why  on-premises storage may not be the best option ?
Large capital expenditure — On-premise systems often require a significant initial outlay, which implies capital expenditure (CapEx) is frequently needed. To assure support and feature improvements, you must also factor in maintenance expenditures.

Maintenance responsibilities - With an on-premises system, you are in charge of disaster recovery, server hardware and software, data backups, and storage. Smaller businesses with constrained financial and technological resources may experience problems with this.

Longer implementation timelines - On-premise solutions take longer since servers and each computers' and laptops' installs must be finished separately.
## Introducing a cloud technology to the enterprise
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a secure, on-demand cloud computing platform that provides a comprehensive service including database storage,
content delivery, and APIs to people, organizations, corporations, and governments.The AWS WA Framework includes domain-specific lenses, hands-on labs, 
and the AWS Well-Architected Tool. The AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool), available at no cost in the AWS Management Console,
 provides a mechanism for regularly evaluating workloads, identifying high-risk issues, and recording improvements. Introducing a cloud tecnology to the enterprise
### AWS
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, ever-changing cloud computing platform offered by Amazon that comprises infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and packaged-software-as-a-service (SaaS) products. AWS services can provide tools like as computational power, database storage, and content delivery services to businesse

### Why AWS is the best option
The cloud provides far higher reliability and uptime than on-premises servers. AWS guarantees 99.95% uptime and has sophisticated backup processes in place to ensure that nothing uploaded to their servers is ever lost.
The way the cloud saves data is one of the key ways it interacts with your firm. Cloud storage, as opposed to on-premise servers with storage, makes use of remote servers maintained by another organization

### Services offered by AWS

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Amazon EC2 is a cloud platform that provides safe and scalable computational capability. Its goal is to provide developers with simple access and usability for web-scale cloud computing while giving you complete control over your compute resources.
### Amazon IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management provides secure access and management of resources in a secure and compliant manner. By leveraging IAM, you can create and manage users and groups by allowing and denying their permissions for individual resources.

### Amazon SQS
AWS SQS is a fully managed message queuing facility enabling you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless apps. SQS purges the intricacies and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and permits developers to focus on diverse workloads.

### Amazon Redshift
Redshift is a data warehouse service that offers cost-effective data analysis on conventional SQL and provides industry-leading performance and simple setup.
### Amazon Sagamaker
SageMaker is a full-fledged management service that gives developers and data scientists the tools they need to quickly construct, train, and deploy machine learning models. Use it to build highly scalable machine learning models that enable faster product deployment and delivery to market.
### Amazon EFS
Elastic File System is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that provides a simple, scalable, and fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS cloud services and on-premises resources. Users may grow on-demand to petabytes without affecting application performance by utilizing EFS, which automatically shifts as files travel, therefore reducing tiresome, manual operations
# conclusion
As technological innovation accelerates, the requirement for constant digital transformation will become increasingly more important. The AWS CAF utilizes AWS knowledge and best practices to help you accelerate your business outcomes via creative usage of AWS. Use the AWS CAF to discover and prioritize transformation opportunities, assess and enhance your cloud readiness, and iteratively update your transformation strategy.
